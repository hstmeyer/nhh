```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

You can write text in **bold** or *italics*.
It's also easy to add bullets:

- Write what you want here
- ... and here

or numbering:

1. Write what you want here
2. ... and here


# Large headings are good

## And so are smaller ones

#### And smaller ones

## Some nice shortcuts you can use 
- ctrl + shift + R (section)
- ctrl + shift + A (reformat section)
- ctrl + shift + N (new file)
- ctrl + tab (change forwards between files)
- ctrl + shift + tab (change backwards between files)
- Alt + Up/Down (move lines of code up/down)
- ctrl + shift + C (comment out selected code)
- ctrl + up (shows command history (when you are in the console)
- ctrl + 1/2/3/4... (move around different panes)
- Alt + - (insert assignment)
- ctrl + shift + m (insert pipe)

## You can of course write R-code

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
head(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()
```
